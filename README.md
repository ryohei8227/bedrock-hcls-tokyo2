# Sample Healthcare and Life Sciences Agents on AWS

Explore the following components in the repository:

## Agents catalog

Library of specialized agents for common workflows across drug research, clinical trials, and commercialization [agent-catalog](agents_catalog/)

## Multi-agent collaboration

Framework for agent collaboration and knowledge sharing. End to end examples for cancer biomarker discovery, clinical trial protocol assistant, and competitive intelligence. [multi-agent-collaboration](multi_agent_collaboration/)

## Evaluation

## Deployment

### 1. Request Amazon Bedrock model access

Request access to the following Amazon Bedrock foundation models using the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

- Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 - Text
- Amazon Nova Pro
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2
- Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet

### 2. Request service quota increase

[Request an increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html#quota-console-increase) of the Amazon Bedrock "Parameters per function" quota to at least 10.

### 3. Deploy the toolkit application and agents for your preferred region

Choose _Launch Stack_ for your preferred region to deploy the toolkit application and selected agents into your AWS account. It may take up to 30 minutes to finish the deployment.

| Name | us-east-1 | us-west-2 |
| -- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| All resources | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=hcls-agent-toolkit&templateURL=https://aws-hcls-ml.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public_assets_support_materials/hcls_agents_toolkit/Infra_cfn.yaml) | [![launch-stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=hcls-agent-toolkit&templateURL=https://aws-hcls-ml.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public_assets_support_materials/hcls_agents_toolkit/Infra_cfn.yaml) |

This will deploy the following agents:

- Cancer Biomarker Discovery (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- Biomarker Database Analyst
- Clinical Evidence Researcher
- Medical Imaging Expert
- Statistician
- Clinical Trial Protocol Assistant (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- Clinical Study Research Agent
- Clinical Trial Protocol Generator Agent
- Wiley Open Access Life Sciences Agent
- Competitive Intelligence (Multi-Agent Supervisor)
- SEC 10-K Search Agent
- Tavily Web Search Agent
- USPTO Search Agent

In most cases, you may leave the default template parameters unchanged. However, several parameters require new values:

- **ReactAppAllowedCidr**: CIDR range from where access to the React UI is allowed. Learn about best practices in the [AWS VPC documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/). To restrict React App UI access to just your IP, first find your IP address through public websites such as [WhatIsMyIpAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and suffix it with 32. For example, if your ip adress is `192.0.2.0` the minimal CIDR range would be `192.0.2.0/32`.

- **RedshiftPassword**: Password for Redshift database login. Remember and store password securely. Must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. Only printable ASCII characters, spaces, and the `/`, `@`, `"`, and `'` values may be used.

- **TavilyApiKey**: API key for the Tavily web search API. Required to deploy the Tavily Web Search and Competitive Intelligence Supervisor agents. Please visit [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/) to create a account and generate an API key.
- **USPTOApiKey**: API key for the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Open Data Portal. Required to deploy the USPTO Search and Competitive Intelligence Supervisor agents. Please visit the [USPO Open Data Portal](https://data.uspto.gov/apis/getting-started) to create a account and generate an API key.

### 4. Access the toolkit application

1. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation via AWS Console search
2. Click the parent stack name that was chosen to deploy the `Infra_cfn.yaml`
3. In the Outputs tab, find the `ReactAppExternalURL` link and add 'https://' to the beginning of the URL and paste in your browser
4. You should be able to see a landing page with all (or a subset) deployed agents as shown in the [video](https://d2dnsxs0d2upyb.cloudfront.net/agents-demo/agents_toolkit_overview.mp4) below:

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Tavily web search](agents_catalog/11-Tavily-web-search-agent/README.md) and [USPTO search](agents_catalog/14-USPTO-search/README.md) tools can be added to your MCP client of choice using the [AWS Lambda MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/lambda-mcp-server/). After installing one of both of them, you can add them to your MCP client configuration:

```json
"hcls-agents": {
   "args": ["awslabs.lambda-mcp-server"],
   "env": {
         "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY ID>",
         "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<YOUR AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY>",
         "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN":"<YOUR AWS SESSION TOKEN>",
         "AWS_REGION": "YOUR AWS REGION",
         "FUNCTION_TAG_KEY": "Application",
         "FUNCTION_TAG_VALUE": "HCLSAgents",
   },
   "command": "uvx"
}
```

Depending on your local environment, you may need to provide the full path to your `uvx` executable. View the [installation instructions](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/lambda-mcp-server/#installation) for more ways to provide AWS credentials to the tools.
